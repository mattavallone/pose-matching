# Pose Estimation and Matching



The goal of this project is to perform human pose estimation and matching. Given two images, a reference image and a trial image, human poses would be detected using keypoints and compared to determine the similarity between them. These key points can be plotted as a 2D stick-figure. The reference image would be overlayed on the trial image to find the similarity between the poses which are depicted in both of the images.
